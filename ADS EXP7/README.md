# Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA Model

Time series forecasting is a critical task in various domains such as finance, economics, and weather prediction. The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is a powerful statistical method commonly used for time series forecasting. This repository contains a comprehensive tutorial on developing ARIMA models for time series forecasting in Python.

## Introduction

This repository serves as a guide for implementing time series forecasting using the ARIMA model in Python. Time series forecasting is crucial for predicting future trends and making informed decisions based on historical data. The ARIMA model, which stands for Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, is a widely used statistical method that can effectively handle various temporal structures present in time series data.

## ARIMA Model Overview

The ARIMA model combines autoregression, differencing, and moving average techniques to model time series data. It consists of three main components:

- Autoregression (AR): Models the relationship between an observation and its lagged observations.
- Integration (I): Achieves stationarity by differencing the time series data.
- Moving Average (MA): Models the relationship between an observation and the residual errors from a moving average model.

The parameters of the ARIMA model, namely p, d, and q, denote the lag order, degree of differencing, and order of the moving average, respectively.

## Getting Started

### Shampoo Sales Dataset

The tutorial begins with loading and visualizing the Shampoo Sales dataset, which provides monthly sales data spanning three years. This dataset serves as a practical example for demonstrating ARIMA modeling techniques.

### ARIMA with Python

The tutorial then proceeds with fitting an ARIMA model to the Shampoo Sales dataset and analyzing the residual errors. It covers steps such as model initialization, training, and making predictions using the ARIMA model.
