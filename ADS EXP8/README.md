# House Price Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting house prices based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and amenities. The project follows the data science lifecycle, including data collection, preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and deployment considerations.

## Key Features

- Data Collection: Obtained dataset from [Kaggle - Housing Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/housing-prices-dataset) and described its features.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned data, handled missing values, and performed feature engineering.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized data distributions and identified outliers.
- Model Development: Trained a Random Forest Regressor model for predicting house prices.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and RÂ².
- Deployment Considerations: Discussed deployment considerations such as API development and scalability.
- Scalability and Real-time Predictions: Explored strategies for enabling real-time predictions and scalability.
